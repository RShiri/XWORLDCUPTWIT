"""
Cross-process scrape lock — serialises WC2026 scrapers so only ONE runs at a time.

Why this exists
---------------
The WhoScored scrape launches undetected-chromedriver, whose patcher renames a
freshly-downloaded chromedriver into a SHARED path
(``%APPDATA%\\undetected_chromedriver\\undetected_chromedriver.exe``). If two
scrapers start at the same moment they race on that rename and one dies with
``[WinError 183] Cannot create a file when that file already exists`` while the
other's Chrome session wedges (120 s read-timeout) and yields zero events —
exactly what silently dropped Morocco-Haiti, South Africa-South Korea and
Paraguay-Australia.

A per-match schedule stagger is NOT sufficient: the Task Scheduler tasks use
``-StartWhenAvailable -WakeToRun``, so several triggers missed while the PC was
asleep all fire together the instant it wakes, defeating any stagger.

This module takes an OS-level exclusive lock on a single lock file, so a second
scraper simply waits for the first to finish regardless of *when* it was
triggered. The lock is advisory at the process level and is released
automatically when the holding process exits (even on crash), so it can never
deadlock the pipeline permanently.
